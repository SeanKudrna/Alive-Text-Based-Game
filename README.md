# Alive
This text based game, 'Alive' Is a mini, choose-your-own-adventure style game with 3 possible endings. 

# Description
You are a programmer tasked with the goal of developing an artificial intelligence algorithm. Will the world crumble? Will it prosper? 

# Background
One of the choices made with this game is how it loops. When you make an incorrect choice, or something that hinders your progress, instead of simply starting the game over
the story is fluid in such a way that the timeline seems linear. The story loops, and you, the player, are trapped until you reach an ending in the dizzying, bleak world
of which you find yourself.

# Have Fun!
Play and see what ending you get!
